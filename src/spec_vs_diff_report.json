  "summary": "Implemented an in-browser, single-page home-screen physics sandbox with device tilt (DeviceOrientation + iOS permission flow), desktop tilt controls (drag pad + arrow keys) and reset, a canvas-based icon renderer backed by a custom 2D physics engine, and a warm amber/teal visual theme. However, the required generated static image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated are not evidenced in the provided diff summary, and Internet Identity/auth-related hooks were added despite being a stated non-goal.",

      "requirement": "Add generated static image assets for a wallpaper background and a small set of app icons, and render them from the frontend as static files under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
      "reason": "The code references /assets/generated/*.png paths, but the diff summary does not show any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated (the required wallpaper and icon PNGs are not evidenced). With truncated/omitted files, this cannot be confirmed as implemented.",
